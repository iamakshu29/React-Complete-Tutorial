Main Purpose of react-router-dom is to display multiple components and to 
make the shifting of one component to another component reload free or without any reload


to create routes to display multiple web components we use react-router-dom

 1. first we install react-router-dom using npm
 2. we import BrowserRouter in main file ie index.js file
 3. then we import switch and route where we want to write our components

 now react router contains 3 parts that are mentioned in point 2 and 3


MOST IMPORTANT
 in new version of React router dom v6 which is a bit different from v5 so some of the keywords are changes along with some methods
1. switch is replaced with <Routes></Routes>
2. component attribute is replaced with element in <Route> tag

Use case 1
If you use exact and strict together, then the location.pathname will only match exactly as provided in path props.

Example:

<Route exact strict path="/one/" component={About}/>
Will only match /one/ but not /one and /one/two.

Use case 2
If you use only strict, then the location.pathname will match which have trailing slash.

Example:

<Route strict path="/one/" component={About}/>
Will match /one/ and /one/two but not /one.

Use case 3
If you use only exact, then the location.pathname will match exact location path.

Example:

<Route exact path="/one" component={About}/>
Will match /one or /one/. The exact props doesn't care for trailing slash. But it will not match /one/two.
