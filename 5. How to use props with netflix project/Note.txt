This mini project gives an idea 
How short a react code can be as compare to HTML 

At first :- we simple make a component then add props to that component for 
different values as an attribute which we called props in react

For example :-
<car model = '2012' name = 'audi' />

Second :- we put all the attribute for differnt card and 
put into an array of object.

data = [
		{
		id:1,model:'2021',name='audi'
		},
	
		{
		id:2,model:'2019',name='ford'
		},
	];

	<car model = {data[0].model} name = {data[0].name} />
	<car model = {data[1].model}  name = {data[1].name} />

Third :- we map all the values using array.map() which make the code more shortes
{
	data.map((value)=>{
		        return(
				<car key={value.id} model = {value.model}  name = {value.name} />
		        );
		})
}

// while using map function a uniques must be added so that in future we get the card by choosing the uniques key 
// and it also gives the warning if we don't use a uniques key
