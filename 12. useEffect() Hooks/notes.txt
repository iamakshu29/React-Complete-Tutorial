When we want to show something after the rendering of component is done 
we use the hook name useEffect()

syntax 
useEffect(()=>{
 <effect you want>
},[]);


useEffect takes a callback function 

1. [] empty array denotes that the effect will happen only once when the page 
is refreshed the very first time

2. to decide which component should trigger the effect, so we need to enter the value 
 of that state in the array....

state is taken from the useState() hook
const [state,setstate] = useState(initialState);

const[num,setNum] = useState(0);

useEffect(()=>{
 <effect you want>
},[num]);

3. to use the effect in every element we have to remove the array
just

useEffect(()=>{
 <effect you want>
});
