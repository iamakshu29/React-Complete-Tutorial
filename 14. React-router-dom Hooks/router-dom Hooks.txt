react-router-dom has total of 4 hooks (I was familiar with)

1. useParams
2. useLocation
3. useHistory
4. useRouteMatch


useParams :-  it returns an object of key/value pairs of URL parameters.

useLocation :- it return the location object that represents the current URL. It is similar to window.location in brwoser DOM
		to display the location we use location.pathname

useHistory :- The useHistory hook gives you access to the history instance that you may use to navigate


In src file all 3 hooks are explained
