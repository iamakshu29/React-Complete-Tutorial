React Context API allows you to easily access data at different levels of the component tree,
without passing prop to every level

ie 
parent
  |
CompA
  |
CompB
  |
CompC

* what context API do for us is if we have to send the data from parent to CompC 
directly without any interference of CompA and CompB then we take the help of 
contextAPI

It is done in three steps :-

1. createContext
2. provide the value
3. consuming the value (complex part or lengthy part)

****************************************************************************

Now the context API is become complex at consumer side ie where we display the value
it becomes like callback hell in ES6 version of JavaScript

To make it easier we use 
useContext()

instead of using the contextName.consumer and a callback func
we need to write only const context =  useContext(Contextname)
and just use that value like we do normally in jsx <h1> my name is {context} </h1>
