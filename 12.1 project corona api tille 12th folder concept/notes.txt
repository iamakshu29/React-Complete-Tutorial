here what we do is just get the api fetch and show the data 

after fetch api we need to show it and in react the easiest way to show data is
to use hooks useEffect and call the api function in useEffect()
so that as soon as the webapage is render function is called

then take the api data in setState() with the help of useState() hooks
then use the data to represent value with the help of map function of array
