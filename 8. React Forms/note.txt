while we are using form tag for input elements then there is a default behaviour of form tag
that it refreshes the page as soon as the button is click .. 
SO to stop the page from refreshing or to prevent this event we call onSubmit() method in form tag 
and under the function we write event.preventDefault() so that the page do not refresh and reset all the values
with form tag its normal to use


2. 
While using input tag we can't get the value normally by using input.value 
we need a function onChange and in this function we have to write event.target.value()
to get the value..


3. 
When ever we need the value from multiple inputs we must use name attribute in input tag
which makes it easy to get the value from different and unique names
